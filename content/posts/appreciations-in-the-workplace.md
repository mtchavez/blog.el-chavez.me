title: Appreciations In The Workplace
description: When appreciations can help build a strong team culture, and how to not overdo it.

Appreciations are something we likely overlook on a day to day basis. Given enough
time and thought to introspect on things in our lives like relationships, work,
family, or hobbies we can quickly start to think of all the things we can, and should, give appreciation for. This can translate well into engineering teams that
work closely together with each other.

## Physiological Effects

The part of the brain that is affected by appreciation and gratitude is the same
part that controls basic bodily functions like eating and sleeping, the
hypothalamus. "_Showing gratitude can increase a person’s wellness, increase better
sleep habits, increase metabolism and lessen stress_". [[1][1]] The effects of
stress on humans is fairly well studied so anything that can help reduce stress
is something worth looking into.

In relationships, personal and work, the act of appreciating someone and taking
notice of their efforts and hard work goes a long way towards strengthening the
relationship. These are some of the reasons I have tried to introduce this simple
act of giving an appreciation in the various work environments I have been a part of.

## Starting Out

Everyone knows how to give out an appreciation most likely. Without a proper
environment to give appreciations it might catch people off guard or make some
uncomfortable if they feel singled out or the current culture of the team isn't
used to this.

Find the best time or place to start giving and showing appreciations. It could
be as easy as letting people submit some appreciations to be shown at the next
company meeting. You may be all communicating in a central place like [Slack][slack]
or [Basecamp][basecamp] where you can create a channel of communicating appreciations
there for everyone to see. I have found that they are most effective in person and
in environments or meetings that are structured as a safe place to speak openly.
One such place for that is a [retrospective][retro] that an agile team might
participate in at the end of their sprint.

## Agile Retrospectives

One common activity for an [agile retrospective][retro] is to allow each team
member to give an appreciation to another team member. Even if your work doesn't
have retrospectives, or even doing agile for that matter, you can still practice
something simple like giving appreciations.

This simple practice at the end of a retrospective is something I have found teams
to both enjoy and also help strengthen camaraderie for better team energy and
performance. A good format is to have everyone in the room take turns giving
their appreciation and giving a brief description of what it is they are appreciating.

## When It Can Be Too Much

This can all sound a little too cheesy, or even a bit much for something like
the workplace or an engineering team. I agree that it is bordering on the concept
of giving trust falls to each other to strengthen the team. This is not lost on
me and I have definitely seen this sort of thing go too far, which can lessen the
effect overall. It's an easy thing to go from thinking _if a little is good, then
why not do it a lot_. But appreciations "_...can have negative effects as well,
such as lowering one’s aspirations. If we spend all of our time being appreciative
and content with the status quo, we draw attention away from future possibilities_". [[2][2]]

When the team or workplace starts giving appreciations for appreciations you can
start to see the negative effects. Other things that can take away from the good
intention is over appreciating for every small thing. Some may think this is just
having a positive attitude and trying to build their co-workers up. But, it actually
does the opposite. We are already in a world of over-consumption and you end up
just added to the noise with the over appreciation of small or common things.

Another common negative effect is forcing or requiring appreciations onto the team.
This can end up leaving some members feeling like it is just another part of the
job requirements and I have seen the appreciations end up being less genuine and
more run of the mill. This cheapens the purpose of doing appreciations in the
first place and others will pick up on this quickly.

## Be Mindful

Even though there are potential pitfalls and negative effects it is more common
to have yourself and those around you benefit from this simple practice. If you,
and whomever you practice this with, are genuine and are mindful when someone can use an
appreciation there will most likely be a majority of positive effects.
Appreciations, like a lot of other things in life, benefit from moderation and
if you focus on quality, meaningful, and pure intentioned over quantity and
status quo I think you will end up benefiting and enjoying the interactions along
the way.
